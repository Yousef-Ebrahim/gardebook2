# gradebook excel project

## by youssef ebrahim

And you can see that the grade book is not just a  simple grade book, but we're going to show what's called conditional formatting. That's what those  little colored dots are. They're going to show who are the top students in your class and who  are the bottom. We're going to do percentiles,   as you can see on the right side. And so several  things about a grade book and formatting data  that we haven't done before and you'll have a  very Nice looking chart when you're finished.
# grade book for employees
we're going to give them a series of  tests for the company, a safety test,   a company philosophy tests, a financial skills  test and a drug test. And then we will give them  employment based on their testing level. So  let's assume these are all new employees.   And they are testing after their job interview.  So this is the completed spreadsheet. 
## have Fun!!!!!
